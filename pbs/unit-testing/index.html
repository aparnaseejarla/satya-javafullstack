                    Introduction
                </h2>

                <p>Hey folks! So I kinda promised to someone I forgot who that I'll write a unit testing guide for this
                    <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/649943542157470?_rdc=1&amp;_rdr">group</a>. There must be
                    hundreds of similar guides out there in the wild, but I feel like most of those I've seen are too
                    short and doesn't really explain the rationale behind unit testing. I think unit testing is one of
                    the most underrated skill that a programmer should learn and sadly it isn't taught in schools (in
                    our country, at least). So here's my take on a (hopefully) gentle introduction to the world of
                    automated testing. </p>

                <p>Anyway, enough with my babbling. Let's get right into it.</p>
                <h2>
                    <a name="naive-way-of-testing-code" href="#naive-way-of-testing-code">
                    </a>
                    Naive way of testing code
                </h2>

                <p>When we first started learning programming, what we'd normally do is write code, run the program.
                    Then conduct tests by entering some inputs hoping that the output is as we desired. If not, we go
                    back writing our code again and fixing bugs.</p>

                <p>Well, there's nothing wrong with that. In fact, for your entire life as a programmer you'd be doing
                    all these three things:</p>

                <p>1) <strong>write</strong> code</p>

                <p>2) <strong>run</strong> the program</p>

                <p>3) <strong>test</strong> the behavior of your program</p>

                <p>Then repeat again</p>

                <p>But you won't always be writing simple console applications. Sooner or later, you'll find yourself
                    doing repetitive tests with slightly varying inputs.</p>

                <p>In the real world where you'd be dealing with much much bigger and more complex software, doing those
                    three things every time will be <strong>very time consuming</strong>. There will also be cases where
                    you need to isolate your changes and just <strong>test a specific part</strong> rather than the
                    whole system.</p>
                <h2>
                    <a name="what-is-unit-testing" href="#what-is-unit-testing">
                    </a>
                    What is Unit testing?
                </h2>

                <p>So instead of running and testing your entire program every time you have to a change in your code,
                    we can automate it by <strong>writing code to test our code</strong>. More specifically, write code
                    that would test a single part of the system isolated from everything else. That's unit testing.</p>
                <h3>
                    <a name="an-analogy" href="#an-analogy">
                    </a>
                    An analogy
                </h3>

                <p>For example, you are building a house and you need some light bulbs. So you go to the store and buy a
                    light bulb. In order to make sure that the light bulb you just bought works, you need to test it.
                </p>

                <p>But the good thing about it is that it's independent of your house. You can test it by itself. No
                    need to actually install it in your house and see if it lights up. Instead, you or the sales
                    assistant can install it to a test bulb socket (found in most hardware or appliance stores) and see
                    if it lights up. You are essentially <strong>testing</strong> a single <strong>unit</strong> of a
                    light bulb which is meant to be part of your house (i.e. the entire system) under construction.</p>

                <p>Imagine if it wasn't possible to test the light bulb alone. You have to go back to your house first,
                    finish building it, install the light bulbs and test if it actually switches on. Quite a hassle,
                    isn't it?</p>

                <h3>
                    <a name="prerequisites" href="#prerequisites">
                    </a>
                    Prerequisites
                </h3>

                <p>Before taking this guide, be sure that you are already familiar with Java language as I will not be
                    going through the detail of compiling and running your Java program. Also be sure to have an
                    internet connection as we will be downloading some tools, and libraries. This guide also assumes
                    that you have an existing project where you want to add unit testing. If not, you can just
                    copy-paste the Java files below and follow along.</p>

                <p>It's also worth noting that the guide, for now, is also written to suit MacOS or Linux users. But
                    experienced Windows users may also want to try anyway (and let me know where it gets difficult! I'll
                    make updates on this guide where necessary).</p>

                <p>Below is short list of everything you need:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Java 8</strong> or higher (I'm using Java 8. But to follow this guide, it doesn't matter
                        if you're using a newer version)
                    </li>
                    <li>Favorite <strong>Code editor or IDE</strong> (I use IntelliJ IDEA myself, but you're free to use
                        whatever you want)</li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Gradle</strong> build tool (download and follow the guide <a
                            href="https://gradle.org/install/">here</a>)

                        <ul>
                            <li>in case you are already using Gradle, you may want to skip to <a
                                    href="#setting-up-the-testing-framework">this step and just add JUnit to your
                                    dependencies</a>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Command Line (Shell or Command Prompt)

                        <ul>
                            <li>we'll be doing things from scratch, so having familiarity working in terminal is a great
                                plus</li>
                            <li>this also makes this guide IDE-agnostic, meaning you don't have to be very dependent on
                                a specific IDE just to make this work</li>
                            <li>if you're on Windows, you may opt to use WSL or the bash prompt that comes with Git (if
                                you are already using one).</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>
                    <a name="a-sample-existing-code" href="#a-sample-existing-code">
                    </a>
                    A sample existing code
                </h3>

                <p>Say we have an existing console application which accepts input of any length from the user and then
                    our program outputs the reverse of the input. Classic problem.</p>

                <p>So we can implement this by writing the following:</p>


                <div class="ltag_gist-liquid-tag">
                    <script id="gist-ltag"
                        src="https://gist.github.com/Gerv-G/9de5cc29fad0a50dd66214fcc2fcc41d/76f17d42cd399981c3c94958b98b320a468f2ed3.js"></script>
                </div>


                <p>You might notice a "bug" here. That's intentional. We'll delve into that later</p>

                <p><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--PxrunrRT--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/if9sag99945nq0la5pi3.png"
                        class="article-body-image-wrapper"><img
                            src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--PxrunrRT--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/if9sag99945nq0la5pi3.png"
                            alt="File structure 1" loading="lazy" width="800" height="274"></a></p>

                <p>At this point, your project structure should look similar to this. It's alright if you don't have the
                    <em>.idea</em> folder or the *<em>.iml</em> file. Those are just IntelliJ IDEA generated files.</p>

                    Setting up the testing framework
                </h3>

                <p>The testing framework that we're gonna use is <strong><a
                            href="https://junit.org/junit4/">JUnit</a>.</strong> To add it in our project, we need a
                    <em>dependency manager</em> such as Gradle.</p>

                <blockquote>
                    <p>💡 <strong>Dependency Manager</strong><br>
                        The great thing about OOP is that it allows us to reuse somebody else's code. Those reusable
                        pieces of code often mature enough that they can be standalone libraries or frameworks. They
                        then get redistributed by various means, either by downloading the JAR files, as in the case of
                        Java, or getting the source code and building it by yourself. These libraries or frameworks
                        become the <em>dependencies</em> of your project. Some of these libraries/frameworks have
                        dependencies of their own, so you also have to take care of them and add them to your project.
                    </p>

                    <p>But doing so multiple times over the duration of your project can be time-consuming, entails
                        difficulties, and is a very repetitive processes. This is where dependency manager comes in.</p>

                    <p>A <strong>dependency manager</strong> is a tool that helps you download libraries and/or
                        frameworks, as well as their dependencies, to add to your project; while also keeping track of
                        the version you are using for each. Some examples of popular dependency managers for Java
                        projects are <strong>Gradle</strong> and <strong>Maven</strong> (which also functions as build
                        tools).</p>

                    <p>For further reading about dependency managers and what they can do, check out <a
                            href="https://medium.com/prodsters/what-are-dependency-managers-26d7d907deb8">this

                <p>If you have prepared the <a href="#prerequisites">prerequisites</a> listed earlier, you should have
                    Gradle already installed in your system. To check, enter the following in your terminal and it
                    should output a directory where you installed Gradle.<br>

                <p>Next, we need to turn our existing console application project into a Gradle project. Expand each

                        <p>You might notice that my shell prompt is different. That's because I'm using zsh with
                            oh-my-zsh, but that's a topic for another day. For now, think of that fancy arrow as the
                            <code>$</code> sign you normally see.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Run your first Gradle build<br>

                        <p>Then you should see an output similar to this:<br>

                </ul>

                <p>You might notice that there are a bunch of files added to your project folder. These are files that
                    are generated by <code>gradle init</code> and will be used by Gradle when building your project. You
                    may happily ignore them for now, but I want to quickly introduce you to one of them, the
                    <code>build.gradle</code> file. This is the file that contains the list of your dependencies and
                    repositories (from which your dependencies will be downloaded). Take a quick look at it and notice
                    that JUnit is already added; this because we picked JUnit earlier when we ran
                    <code>gradle init</code> .</p>


                <div class="ltag_gist-liquid-tag">

                </div>



                <p>You may also notice that <code>main</code> and <code>test</code> folders are added to the project. We
                    will use them to reorganize our code.</p>

                <h3>

                    Separating source code and test code
                </h3>

                <p>Gradle isn't smart enough to know that you already have existing code in your project, and assumes
                    that you are starting a Gradle project from scratch. So it creates its own folders, package, the
                    class named <code>App.java</code> with the <code>main()</code> method.</p>

                <p>After running <code>gradle init</code> , your project directory should look like this.<br>

                <p>But we already have <a href="#a-sample-existing-code">ConsoleApplication.java</a> and that serves as
                    the main entry point of our application so we can just get rid of <code>App.java</code>. We also
                    don't need the package <code>HelloUnitTesting</code> since we already have an existing one from
                    before. Delete them as you normally would, or if you're like me and you like doing everything in
                    terminal<br>

                <p>If you're also using IntelliJ IDEA, you might notice that <code>main/java</code> is marked like a
                    package even though it isn't. To make them appear like normal folders, simply right click on the
                    <code>src</code> then point to <em>Mark Directory As</em> and pick <em>Unmark as Sources Root</em>.
                    Then right click on <code>java</code> folder under <code>main</code> then <em>Mark Directory As</em>
                    and pick <em>Sources Root.</em> Do the same thing with the <code>java</code> folder under
                    <code>test</code>, but pick <em>Test Sources Root</em>. For the <code>resources</code> folder, mark
                    them as <em>Resources Root</em> and <em>Test Resources Root</em> for <code>main</code> and
                    <code>test</code> respectively.</p>

                <p>If you've carefully followed the instructions, your project directory should now look something like

                <p>If your gradle build is successful but your IDE is complaining (i.e. squiggly red lines, you can just
                    reimport/reopen your project and hopefully your IDE recognizes that it's now a Gradle project.</p>

                <p><strong>Quick Recap!</strong><br>
                    That's a lot of things we've already covered. Here's what we've done so far:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>turn our project into a Gradle project</li>
                    <li>add JUnit to our dependencies</li>
                    <li>Reorganize our project folders</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>
                    <a name="writing-your-first-unit-test" href="#writing-your-first-unit-test">
                    </a>
                    Writing your first unit test
                </h3>

                <p>Now that we have finished setting up our project and its dependencies, we are now ready to write our
                    unit test!</p>

                <p>Under the <code>test/java</code> folder, create a package <code>com.gerv.guev</code> or whatever
                    package name you already used in your project. Then create a file named
                    <code>MyStringUtilitiesTest.java</code>. You may copy the contents of the class for now, I'll
                    explain what it does along the way.</p>


                <div class="ltag_gist-liquid-tag">
                    <script id="gist-ltag"
                        src="https://gist.github.com/Gerv-G/5aa84d5f186bab82fcf898ec036774e7/c91b719c0a92ef76ab0edd6aa20a1f2d5d2fd559.js"></script>
                </div>



                <p>Then we are going to add a test method that actually does nothing. We're taking very small steps to
                    make sure we're not making mistakes and everything is still working as it is.</p>


                <div class="ltag_gist-liquid-tag">
                    <script id="gist-ltag"
                        src="https://gist.github.com/Gerv-G/5aa84d5f186bab82fcf898ec036774e7/0e025920197746f91636292c417273b00b1e8972.js"></script>
                </div>


                <p>In the code above, <code>@Test</code> is an annotation that tells our compiler that the method that
                    we just wrote is a <strong>test method</strong>. <code>@Test</code> annotation is located under the
                    <code>org.junit</code> package (notice the <code>import</code> statement above).</p>

                <p>A method marked as a <strong>test method</strong> will be checked by the test runner if it satisfies
                    some conditions we are expecting. In this case, the test should always pass because we told it to
                    <code>assert true</code> which will always be true no matter what. The point of writing this the
                    first time is to check if our unit testing framework was really set up correctly. After you've
                    written one or if you're already familiar with the testing framework your are using, there's no need
                    to write this one every time.</p>

                <p>To run the test, type in this command<br>
                </p>

                <p>In the command above, we are telling Gradle to run the test found in a fully qualified name. In this
                    case we're telling it to specifically run <code>someUselessTest()</code> test method.</p>

                <p>A <strong>fully qualified name</strong> consists of the package name, class name, and method name. It
                    represents the hierarchical location of your file or folder and should always be unique.</p>

                <p>But if you have multiple tests inside a class or package, you can just replace it with an asterisk
                    (*) and it should still run<br>
