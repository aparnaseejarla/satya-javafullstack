            <h1 id="version">1. Get familiar with version control, Git and GitHub</h1>

            <h2 id="what-is-version-control">What is version control?</h2>

            <p>Version control allows you to keep track of your work and helps you to easily explore the changes you
                have made, be it data, coding scripts, notes, etc. You are probably already doing some type of version
                control, if you save multiple files, such as <code
                    class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Dissertation_script_25thFeb.R</code>, <code
                    class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Dissertation_script_26thFeb.R</code>, etc. This
                approach will leave you with tens or hundreds of similar files, making it rather cumbersome to directly
                compare different versions, and is not easy to share among collaborators. With version control software
                such as <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a>, version control is much smoother and easier to
                implement. Using an online platform like <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a> to store your files
                means that you have an online back up of your work, which is beneficial for both you and your
                collaborators.</p>

            <p>Git uses the command line to perform more advanced actions and we encourage you to look through the <a
                    href="#github4">extra resources we have added at the end of the tutorial later</a>, to get more
                comfortable with Git. But until then, here we offer a gentle introduction to syncing RStudio and Github,
                so you can start using version control in minutes.</p>

            <h2 id="what-are-the-benefits-of-using-version-control">What are the benefits of using version control?</h2>

            <p>Having a GitHub repo makes it easy for you to keep track of collaborative and personal projects - all
                files necessary for certain analyses can be held together and people can add in their code, graphs, etc.
                as the projects develop. Each file on GitHub has a history, making it easy to explore the changes that
                occurred to it at different time points. You can review other people’s code, add comments to certain
                lines or the overall document, and suggest changes. For collaborative projects, GitHub allows you to
                assign tasks to different users, making it clear who is responsible for which part of the analysis. You
                can also ask certain users to review your code. For personal projects, version control allows you to
                keep track of your work and easily navigate among the many versions of the files you create, whilst also
                maintaining an online backup.</p>

            <h2 id="how-to-get-started">How to get started</h2>

            <p><strong>Please register on the <a href="https://github.com/">Github website</a>.</strong></p>

            <p>On your computer, you need to install Git first. The process will depend on your operating system: please
                follow the instructions below by clicking the relevant button.</p>

            <details class="reveal-container">
                <summary class="reveal">Linux</summary>

                <p>If you are using a Linux distribution, you can usually install Git by running the following command
                    in the Terminal:</p>

                <div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge">
                    <div class="highlight">

                    </div>
                </div>

                <p>If this doesn’t work, look up Git installation instructions for your distribution.</p>

                <p>If you are on a personal Mac machine, install Git via Homebrew, which is a package manager for
                    command line programs on Mac. First, open a terminal, which can be found at <code
                        class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~/Application/Utilities/Terminal.app</code>. Then,
                    copy and paste this line into the terminal and hit “Enter”:</p>

                <p>Follow any instructions in the terminal window, you may need to enter your Mac’s password or agree to

            </details>

            <p>The files you put on GitHub will be public (i.e. everyone can see them &amp; suggest changes, but only
                the people with access to the repository can directly edit and add/remove files). You can also have
                private repositories on GitHub, which means that only you can see the files. GitHub now offers <a
                    href="https://blog.github.com/2019-01-07-new-year-new-github/">free private repositories as
                    standard</a> with up to three collaborators per repository. They also offer a free education
                package, with access to software and other perks, you can apply for one using <a
                    href="https://education.github.com/discount_requests/new">this link</a>.</p>

            <h2 id="how-does-version-control-work">How does version control work?</h2>

            <h3 id="what-is-a-repository">What is a repository?</h3>

            <p>You can think of a repository (<em>aka</em> a repo) as a “main folder”, everything associated with a
                specific project should be kept in a repo for that project. Repos can have folders within them, or just
                be separate files.</p>

            <p>You will have a local copy (on your computer) and an online copy (on GitHub) of all the files in the
                repository.</p>

            <h3 id="the-workflow">The workflow</h3>

            <p>The GitHub workflow can be summarised by the “commit-pull-push” mantra.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Commit
                    <ul>
                        <li>Once you’ve saved your files, you need to commit them - this means the changes you have made
                            to files in your repo will be saved as a version of the repo, and your changes are now ready
                            to go up on GitHub (the online copy of the repository).</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Pull
                    <ul>
                        <li>Now, before you send your changes to Github, you need to pull, i.e. make sure you are
                            completely up to date with the latest version of the online version of the files - other
                            people could have been working on them even if you haven’t. You should always pull before
                            you start editing and before you push.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Push
                    <ul>
                        <li>Once you are up to date, you can push your changes - at this point in time your local copy
                            and the online copy of the files will be the same.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>

            <p>Each file on GitHub has a history, so instead of having many files like <code
                    class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Dissertation_1st_May.R</code>, <code
                    class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Dissertation_2nd_May.R</code>, you can have only one
                and by exploring its history, you can see what it looked at different points in time.</p>

            <p>For example, here is the history for a repo with an R script inside it, as viewed on Github. Obviously it
                took me a while to calculate those model predictions!</p>

            <p><img src="/assets/img/tutorials/git/filehistory.png" alt="Github commit history screenshot" /></p>

            <h1 id="github2">2. Create your own repository and project folder structure</h1>

            <p>To make a repository, go to <code
                    class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Repositories/New repository</code> - choose a concise
                and informative name that has no spaces or funky characters in it. This can be your master repo that
                holds together past and ongoing research, data, scripts, manuscripts. Later on you might want to have
                more repositories - e.g. a repository associated with a particular project that you want to make public
                or a project where you are actively seeking feedback from a wider audience. For now, we will focus on
                organising and using your main repository that holds the files for all your work. With a free GitHub
                account, you can use public or private respositories.</p>

            <p><img src="/assets/img/tutorials/git/newrepo.png" alt="Github create new repository screenshot" /></p>

            <p>Let’s create a new private repository. You can call it whatever you like if the name is available.</p>

            <p><img src="/assets/img/tutorials/git/newrepo2.png" alt="Github create new repository" /></p>

            <p><strong>Click on <code
                        class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Initialise repo with a README.md file</code></strong>.
                It’s common practice for each repository to have a <code
                    class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">README.md</code> file, which contains information about
                the project, the purpose of the repository, as well as any comments on licensing and data sources.
                Github understands several text formats, including <code
                    class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.txt</code> and <code
                    class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.md</code>. <code
                    class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.md</code> stands for a file written in <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown</a>. You might have used Markdown before from
                within <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RStudio</code> to create neatly organised
                reports of your code and its outputs (you can also check out our <a
                    href="/tutorials/rmarkdown/index.html">Markdown tutorial</a>. You can also use Markdown to write
                plain text files, for example the file you are reading now was written in Markdown.</p>

            <p><strong>We will also create a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.gitignore</code>
                    file</strong>. This file lets Git know what kind of files should not be included in the repository.
                We’ll have a look at that file in a bit. Tick the box, then search for <strong>R</strong> in the
                drop-down template (or whatever programming language you will be using for the project).</p>

            <p>Once you are ready, click on <strong>Create repository</strong>.</p>

            <p><img src="/assets/img/tutorials/git/newrepo3.png" alt="Github create new repository" /></p>

            <p>Here is how the repository should look:</p>

            <p><img src="/assets/img/tutorials/git/github_repo_first_view.png" alt="Github new repository first view" />
            </p>

            <p>You can directly edit your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">README.md</code> file on
                Github by clicking on the file and then selecting <code
                    class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Edit this file</code>.</p>

            <h2 id="exercise-1-write-an-informative-readmemd-file">Exercise 1: Write an informative README.md file</h2>

            <p>You can now write the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">README.md</code> file for your
                repository. To make headings and subheadings, put hashtags before a line of text - the more hashtags,
                the smaller the heading will appear. You can make lists using <code
                    class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-</code> and numbers <code
                    class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1, 2, 3, etc.</code>. <strong>When working on a shared

                so, specify a <strong>commit message</strong> which briefly describes the changes. <strong>Commit
                    messages should concise, but descriptive.</strong> Select <strong>Commit directly to the <code
                        class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">main</code> branch</strong> and then click on

                In this file you specify which files you want Git to ignore when users make changes and add files.
                Examples include temporary Word, Excel and Powerpoint files, <code
                    class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.Rproj</code> files, <code
                    class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.Rhist</code> files, etc. Some files you might want to
                only have on your local repository (i.e. on your computer), but not online as they might be too big to
                store online.</p>

            <p>Select the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.gitignore</code> and click ‘Edit’. As you
                will see, the template GitHub provides for R already includes many file types usually found in R
                projects that should not be included in shared repositories. You can add more files by specifying each
                file type on a separate line. <strong>Scroll to the bottom of the document and paste the following
                    additions, without overwriting the rest</strong>. Comments in the file are designated by a <code
                    class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#</code> sign. Then, commit the file to the <code
                    class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">main</code> branch.</p>

            <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">

            <h2 id="exercise-3-create-folders">Exercise 3: Create folders</h2>

            <p>Think of different folders you may want to include in your repository. If working on a shared repo,
                discuss with your collaborators. For the repository for a lab group, some examples include: manuscripts,
                data, figures, scripts, scripts/users/personal_folder_your_name. To make a new folder, click on <code
                    class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Create new file</code> and add in the name of your new
                folder, e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">manuscripts/</code> before the file
                name, in this case a quick <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">README.md</code> file.
                When creating folders within your repo through GitHub’s website, you always need to make at least one
                file associated with them, you can’t just create an empty folder. You can then write and commit the
                file.</p>

            <h2 id="github-etiquette">GitHub etiquette</h2>

            <p>If you’ll be sharing the repository with collaborators and even for your own benefit, it’s a good idea to
                define some rules on how to use the repository before we start working within it - for example what
                GitHub and coding etiquette should people be following? Is there a prefered folder structure, file
                naming system?</p>

            <p>We can make a new <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">github-etiquette.md</code> file that
                outlines the rules that people with access to your repository should follow.</p>

                    class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Create new file</code> and add <code
                    class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">github-etiquette.md</code> as a file name. Remember to
                include the file extension <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.md</code> - otherwise

                paste the HTTPS link from the Github repository into the <code

            <p>Once you attempt the project, you will be asked to authenticate. <strong>You only need to do this once on
                    your computer.</strong> There are multiple possible ways to authenticate your GitHub account on your
                computer and make it work with RStudio. Here are two recommended approaches:</p>

            <details class="reveal-container">

                <h3 id="create-a-personal-access-token-all-platforms">Create a Personal Access Token (All platforms)
                </h3>

                <p>Creating a Personal Access Token (PAT) is the recommended most secure method for all platforms.
                    However, if you are using Windows (as of September 2021) you may be able to authenticate using the
                    quick “Sign in via browser” option. If you wish to do so, follow the instructions under the next
                    button (Sign in via internet browser (Windows only)).</p>

                <p>You can create a PAT using the GitHub website and specify the exact permissions that it provides your
                    computer when interacting with GitHub in the cloud. We will create a token that allows for access
                    and modifications to the repository.</p>

                <p><strong><em>Step 1:</em></strong> Create PAT at GitHub website</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>In the <strong>GitHub website</strong>, click on your profile picture in the top-right corner
                        and go to <strong>Settings</strong>.</li>
                    <li>In the left sidebar, go to <strong>Developer settings</strong>. Then, again in the left sidebar,
                        click <strong>Personal access tokens</strong>.</li>
                    <li>Click <strong>Generate new token</strong>. Give the token a name (something that describes what
                        you will use it for, e.g. “Local machine token”).</li>
                    <li>Select an <strong>Expiration time</strong>. You can set to no expiration so that you will not
                        have to re-authenticate.</li>
                    <li>Then, select the <strong>permissions</strong> you grant to this token. Simply select the
                        <strong>“repo”</strong> group in bold.</li>
                    <li>Click <strong>Generate token</strong>. Make sure to <strong>copy the token</strong> and store it
                        securely, since the website will not show it to you again. (If something goes wrong, you can
                        always generate a new one.)</li>
                </ol>

                </p>

                <p><strong><em>Step 2:</em></strong> Authenticate (within RStudio)</p>

                <p>On <strong>Windows</strong>, once you interact with a private repository you should get a prompt
                    looking like this:</p>

                <p>Simply paste the token into the Personal access token field and continue.</p>

                <p>On <strong>Linux/macOS</strong>, you should get a prompt for your username and then for your
                    password. Input your GitHub username, and <strong>under password, input your PAT instead</strong>.
                </p>

                <p>Your authentication should now be successful and you can interact with GitHub repositories directly
                    from RStudio.</p>

                <p>Do you have troubles with authenticating with GitHub? Follow this guide to remove GitHub
                    authentication from your computer and sign in anew.</p>

                <p>Important: This is relevant if you used GitHub in an RStudio project before August 13, 2021 and it
                    has since stopped working. This has likely occurred due to changes implemented by GitHub on that
                    date to make authentication more secure. Here is how to fix this issue, by removing GitHub
                    authentication credentials from your computer and logging in again. These instructions may be
                    helpful for other GitHub authentication issues as well.</p>

                <p><strong><em>Step 1 (all platforms):</em></strong></p>

                <p>In your R session in RStudio, execute the following lines:</p>

                <div class="language-r highlighter-rouge">
                    <div class="highlight">
                        <pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">install.packages</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'gitcreds'</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w">

                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>Do not worry if you receive a warning or error and proceed to the next step.
                    Close RStudio (important!).</p>

                <p><strong><em>Step 2:</em></strong></p>

                <p><strong>Windows</strong></p>

                <p>In the <strong>Start Menu</strong>, search for and open <strong>Credential Manager</strong>. Click on
                    <strong>Windows Credentials</strong>. For all listed items that include ‘github’, click on the arrow
                    and then click <strong>Remove</strong>. Close the window.</p>

                <p><strong><em>Step 3:</em></strong>
                    Open your project within RStudio again and attempt to interact with the GitHub repository (e.g. Pull
                    any changes). You should see a prompt to authenticate. Follow the instructions under the buttons

                <p>We know that there might be problems with the newest updates of the Mac software and installing git
                    and linking it with RStudio. The solutions appear to be very specific to the Mac version you have,
                    so if the above steps didn’t work, a good starting point is googling "rstudio can’t find git mac
                    <strong>your version</strong>" and trying out the suggested solutions.</p>

            </div>

            <p>Once the files have finished copying across (this may take a while depending on the size of the repo
                you’re joining), you will notice that a few things about your RStudio session have changed: there is a
                <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Git</code> tab in the top right corner of RStudio,
                and all the files that are in the repo are now on your computer as well.</p>

            <p>You are now ready to start making changes and documenting them through Github! <strong>Note that you
                    can’t push empty folders.</strong></p>

            <p>You can open some of the files you made online earlier - for example if you click on your <code
                    class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">README.md</code> file, it will open in <code
                    class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RStudio</code> and you can make changes. Add some more
                text just for the sake of exemplifying how version control works. Save the file in the same location
                (i.e., your repository).</p>

            <p><img src="/assets/img/tutorials/git/readme_edit.png" alt="RStudio Git staging area screenshot" /></p>

            <p>If you click on the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Git</code> tab you will see that
                now your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">README.md</code> file is listed there. Add a
                tick next to it. Now it has an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">M</code> - this means
                you have modified the file. If there’s an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">A</code>,
                that’s an added file, and a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">D</code> is a deleted
                file.</p>

            <p>If you select the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">README.md</code> file and click on
                <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Diff</code>, you will see the changes you have made.
                Once the file is selected, it is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">staged</code>, ready
                to be commited to Github.</p>

                    class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">origin/main</code> branch - that is the branch that is
                on Github - we now need to let Github know about the changes we have made.</p>

            <p><img src="/assets/img/tutorials/git/git4.png" alt="RStudio Git branch status screenshot" /></p>

            <p>We can’t repeat it enough: <strong>always <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Pull</code>
                    before you <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Push</code>.</strong> <code
                    class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Pull</code> means that you are retrieving the most
                recent version of the Github repository onto your local branch - this command is especially useful if
                several people are working within the same repository - imagine there was a second script examining soil
                pH along this elevation gradient, and your collaborator was working on it the same time as you - you
                wouldn’t want to “overwrite” their work and cause trouble. In this case, you are the only one working on
                these files, but it’s still good to develop the practice of pulling before you push. Once you’ve pulled,
                you’ll see a message that you are already up to date, you can now push! Click on <code
                    class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Push</code>, wait for the loading to be over and then
                click on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Close</code> - that was it, you have
                successfully pushed your work to Github!</p>

            <p>Go back to your repository on Github, where you can now see all of your updated files online.</p>

            <p><img src="/assets/img/tutorials/git/updated_repo.png" alt="Github repository updated screenshot" /></p>

            <p>Click on your script file and then on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">History</code> -
                this is where you can see the different versions of your script - obviously in real life situations you
                will make many changes as your work progresses - here we just have two. Thanks to Github and version
                control, you don’t need to save hundreds of almost identical files (e.g. <code
                    class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Dissertation_script_25thFeb.R</code>, <code
                    class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Dissertation_script_26thFeb.R</code>) - you have one
                file and by clicking on the different commits, you can see what it looked like at different points in
                time.</p>

            <p><img src="/assets/img/tutorials/git/repo_history.png" alt="Github commit history screenshot" /></p>

            <p><strong>You are now ready to add your scripts, plots, data files, etc. to your new project directory and
                    follow the same workflow as outlined above - stage your files, commit, pull, push.</strong></p>

            <h2 id="potential-problems">Potential problems</h2>

            <p>Sometimes you will see error messages as you try to commit-pull-push. Usually the error message
                identifies the problem and which file it’s associated with, if the message is more obscure, googling it
                is a good step towards solving the problem. Here are some potential problems that might arise:</p>

            <h3 id="code-conflicts">Code conflicts</h3>

            <p>While you were working on a certain part of a script, someone else was working on it, too. When you go
                through commit-pull-push, GitHub will make you decide which version you want to keep. This is called a
                code conflict, and you can’t proceed until you’ve resolved it. You will see arrows looking like <code
                    class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</code> around the
                two versions of the code - delete the version of the code you don’t want to keep, as well as the arrows,
                and your conflict should disappear.</p>

            <h3 id="pushing-the-wrong-files">Pushing the wrong files</h3>

            <p>If you accidentally push what you didn’t intend to, deleted many things (or everything!) and then pushed
                empty folders, you can revert your commit. You can keep reverting until you reach the point in time when
                everything was okay. This is an easy way out if you’re the only person working in the repository -
                <strong>be aware that if there are other people that have committed to the repository, reverting will
                    also undo all of their work, as reverting refers to the repository as a whole, not just your own
                    work in it.</strong></p>

            <p>Using these “undo” commands can be daunting, so make sure you read up on the different commands before
                you attempt anything that may delete work permanently: <a
                    href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/undoing-changes/git-revert">here’s a starter</a>. It’s
                a good idea to regularly back up your repository to an external hard drive <em>juuuust</em> in case!</p>

            <h3 id="verified-commits">Verified commits</h3>

            <p>When you browse your commit history through the GitHub website, you may notice that commits made through
                the website are listed as “Verified”, while commits pushed from your computer are not. This is generally
                not a big deal, but in large collaborative projects you may want to verify your locally made commits -
                <a
                    href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/about-commit-signature-verification">here
                    is a guide how</a>.</p>

            <h1 id="github4">4. Sync and interact with your repository through the command line</h1>

            <p>Traditionally, Git uses the command line to perform actions on local Git repositories. In this tutorial
                we ignored the command line but it is necessary if you want more control over Git. There are several
                excellent introductory guides on version control using Git, e.g. <a
                    href="http://simon-m-mudd.github.io/NMDM_book/#_version_control_with_git">Prof Simon Mudd’s
                    Numeracy, Modelling and Data management guide</a>, <a
                    href="https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/">The Software Carpentry guide</a>, and this <a
                    href="https://github.com/BES2016Workshop/version-control">guide from the British Ecological Society
                    Version Control workshop</a>. For more generic command line tools, look at this <a
                    href="https://www.git-tower.com/blog/command-line-cheat-sheet">general cheat sheet</a> and this <a
                    href="https://github.com/0nn0/terminal-mac-cheatsheet">cheat sheet for mac users</a>. We have also
                created a table and flow diagram with some basic Git commands and how they fit into the Git/Github
                workflow. Orange lines refer to the core workflow, the blue lines describe extra functions and the green
                lines deal with branches:</p>

            <p>Below is a quick exercise so you can familiarise yourself with these command line tools. There are a few
                ways to use interact with Git using the terminal:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>If you are already in RStudio on a Mac or Linux machine, you can open a terminal within RStudio by
                    going to <code
                        class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Tools -&gt; Terminal -&gt; New Terminal</code> in
                    the menu.</li>
                <li>If you are on a Mac or Linux machine you could just open a terminal program and run Git from there.
                    Most Mac and Linux machines will have Git installed by default. On Mac you can go open a terminal by
                    going to: <code
                        class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app</code>.</li>
                <li>If you are on a personal Windows machine, you can run Git using Git Bash, which can be installed
                    when you installed Git. You should be able to launch it from More -&gt; Shell in RStudio. If that
                    doesn’t work, look up the programme under your Start Menu.</li>
            </ol>


            <p>Once you have opened a terminal using one of the above methods, start by creating a folder somewhere on
                your local system called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git_test</code>, using the
                <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mkdir</code> (make directory) command by typing the
                following into the terminal and hitting “Enter”. For example, to create the directory in the Documents
                folder:</p>

            <div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge">
                <div class="highlight">
                    <pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">mkdir</span> ~/Documents/git_test
</code></pre>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>Then enter that folder using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cd</code> (change
                directory):</p>

            <div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge">
                <div class="highlight">
                    <pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">cd</span> ~/Documents/git_test
</code></pre>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>To make the folder into a Git repository:</p>

            <div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge">
                <div class="highlight">
                    <pre class="highlight"><code>git init
</code></pre>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>Now the folder has been made into a Git repository, allowing you to track changes to files. Now, lets
                create a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">README.md</code> file inside the repository
                and put some text in it, using whatever text editor you are comfortable with. Make sure to place this
                <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">README.md</code> file into the repository folder on
                your device so it can be found!</p>

            <p>You can create empty text files via a single command in the shell:</p>

            <div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge">
                <div class="highlight">
                    <pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">touch </span>README.md
<span class="nb">touch</span> .gitignore
<span class="nb">touch </span>test.R
</code></pre>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>Now, to add a file to be tracked by the Git repository:</p>

            <div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge">
                <div class="highlight">
                    <pre class="highlight"><code>git add README.md
</code></pre>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>To check what files have been staged and unstaged changes:</p>
            <div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge">
                <div class="highlight">
                    <pre class="highlight"><code>git status
</code></pre>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>The README.md file has now been added to the staging area, but has not yet been committed to a version of
                the repository. To commit a version:</p>

            <div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge">
                <div class="highlight">
                    <pre class="highlight"><code>git commit <span class="nt">-m</span> <span class="s2">"Your commit message here"</span>
</code></pre>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>Currently, the Git repository is still only on our local computer. Versions are being committed, but they
                are not being backed up to a remote version of the repository on Github. Go to Github and create a
                repository called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git_test</code>, like you did
                earlier on in the workshop, but this time don’t create a <code
                    class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">README.md</code> because we have just made one on the
                local computer. Now, copy the HTTPS link for that repository. In the terminal, link the local Git
                repository with the remote repository using the following code, replacing <code
                    class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;HTTPS_LINK&gt;</code> with the link you copied:</p>

            <div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge">
                <div class="highlight">
                    <pre class="highlight"><code>git remote add origin &lt;HTTPS_LINK&gt;
</code></pre>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>Then make the first push to that newly linked remote repository:</p>

            <div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge">
                <div class="highlight">
                    <pre class="highlight"><code>git push <span class="nt">-u</span> origin main
</code></pre>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>Now you can continue editing files, adding changes (<code
                    class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git add &lt;FILE&gt;</code>), committing changes (<code
                    class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git commit</code>), pulling (<code
                    class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git pull</code>) and pushing (<code
                    class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git push</code>) changes, similar to the process you
                did with clicking buttons in RStudio. Feel free to explore some of the more advanced commands laid out
                in the table and flow diagram above. You can also check out a more advanced command line tutorial
